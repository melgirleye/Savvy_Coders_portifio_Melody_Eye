Thank you for visiting my website. My name is Melody Eye. I created this website to display my profile to others (especially some of the media-related work that I have completed). I have worked with several different types of media. A few areas that I have received experience in are web design, radio show broadcasting, and graphic design.

According to the Clifton StrengthsFinder test, my top five Strengths are Ideation, Communication, Command, Self-Assurance, and Woo. I feel like these top five strengths fit my personality well. For example, I am always coming up with new ideas. I love being innovative and inventive. Also, communication is my strong suit and I believe most problems can be solved with effective communication solutions.

I am a good team player that can work independently as well as with others. When I am in leadership positions I also have great delegation skills which I feel is complementary to my managerial skills.

A few additional things about me are that I enjoy cooking, swimming, and playing cards. I also love to network with other business professionals so please feel free to contact me if you would like to chat or grab a cup of coffee sometime. Thank you again for visiting my website.
